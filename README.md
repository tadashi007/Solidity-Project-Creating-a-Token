# CREATE YOUR OWN TOKEN USING SOLIDITY
This Solidity Program is a simple program that demonstrates the basic functionality of the Solidity Programming Language.
In this Project, we will create our own token using Solidity Programming Language.


## Description
The following program represents a basic token contract that can be used to create and manage custom tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the minting of tokens to specific addresses, increasing the total supply, and the burning of tokens from addresses, reducing the total supply. The contract also keeps track of token balances for different addresses. This program serves as a foundation for building and deploying custom tokens with basic functionality.


## Getting Started

### Installing
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

### Executing program
1. Create a file on Remix
  * To start building a smart contract, click on New File and name it MyToken.sol.

2. Upload a pre-built smart contract into the IDE
  * Copy and paste the Smart Contract code provided into the newly created MyToken.sol file.

3. Compile the smart contract
   1. Go to the Solidity Compiler tab (below the search button).
   2. Select compiler version to 0.5.10.
   3. Now, compile MyToken.sol.
   4. After successful compilation, it will show a green tick mark on the Compiler tab button.

4. Deploy the smart contract
 * Once MetaMask is connected to Remix, the Deploy transaction would generate another MetaMask popup that requires transaction confirmation. Simply confirm the transaction!

5. Verify the smart contract.
